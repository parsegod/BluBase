Ready to get this blueprint tracker up and running on your local machine? It's super simple!

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   First things first, grab a copy of the project files. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:


    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/Liamcky/BlueprintPulling)
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```
    cd blueprint-pull-table
    ```

3. **Crucial:**  `assets/weapon.json`
* `0This application relies on a weapon.json file located in the assets/ directory to populate its data. Please ensure this file exists and is correctly formatted according to the Data Format section below. If it's missing, the table won't load any data.`

4. **Open in Your Browser**:
* You can simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
*Self-hosting for development?* For a more robust development experience (especially if you're making changes), consider using a local web server. Python's built-in server is a great option:


    ```
    # run from the project root directory ( {ProjectLocation}/BlueprintPulling )
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

* Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

#                                                    📊 Data Format

The `categoryMap` in `script.js` is where the magic happens, translating those numeric `Category` IDs into human-readable names:

**Important Note on Images**: Blueprint images are expected to follow a specific naming convention and path: `assets/blueprints/images/{WeaponName}/{BlueprintName}.jpg`. Ensure your image files match this structure for them to load correctly
